## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report**
* Check the [existing issues](../../issues) to see if the problem has already been reported.
* Perform a [cursory search](../../search?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to see if the issue has already been resolved.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](../../issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion**
* Check if there's already [a feature request](../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) for what you want to suggest.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](../../issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps** or point out the part of the template where the suggestion is related to.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most GitHub Actions Templates users.

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Follow the styleguides
- After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Git
- A GitHub account
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions

### Setting Up the Repository

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-actions-templates.git
cd github-actions-templates
```

3. Create a branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-template
```

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### GitHub Actions Workflow Style Guide

* Use clear, descriptive names for workflows and jobs
* Include comments for complex steps
* Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
* Group related steps together
* Use meaningful step names

### YAML Style Guide

* Use 2-space indentation
* Use kebab-case for file names
* Quote strings that contain special characters
* Use consistent naming conventions for inputs and outputs

## Template Development Guidelines

### Creating New Workflow Templates

1. Start with a clear purpose: Each template should solve a specific problem
2. Make it reusable: Use inputs and secrets for configuration
3. Include documentation: Add comments and update the README
4. Test thoroughly: Verify the workflow works in different scenarios
5. Follow security best practices: Use minimal permissions and handle secrets properly

### Example Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Descriptive Workflow Name

on:
  # Define triggers

env:
  # Set default environment variables

jobs:
  job-name:
    name: Descriptive Job Name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Clear step description
      uses: action/name@version
      with:
        # Inputs
```

## Creating Composite Actions

### 1. Define clear inputs and outputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  node-version:
    description: 'Node.js version to use'
    required: false
    default: '18'
outputs:
  cache-hit:
    description: 'Whether the cache was restored'
    value: ${{ steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit }}
```

### 2. Handle errors gracefully:

```yaml
- name: Run command
  shell: bash
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    # Your commands here
```

### 3. Provide usage examples in the README

## Testing Your Changes

### Testing Workflows

1. Create a test repository or use your fork

2. Reference your branch in workflow files:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    uses: your-username/github-actions-templates/.github/workflows/ci.yml@your-branch
```

3. Trigger the workflow and verify it works as expected

## Testing Composite Actions

1. Create a test workflow that uses your action:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Test my action
    uses: your-username/github-actions-templates/.github/actions/setup-environment@your-branch
```
